## Intro Agile

Agile is a software delivery philosophy, developed to combat traditional software development (Waterfall) that was reliant on processes over people.

Agile came about as a set of principles, with various implementations (e.g. TDD, Scrum, Lean, Kanban).

For an organisation to adopt agile, it requires a big shift in the mindset, culture and the way the teams are organised.

Different organisations are scattered along the agile "scale". The more agile is done properly, the more the organisation can benefit from it e.g. more flexibility, easier for the developers to focus and remove blockers, overall more likely to meet the requirements.

## Scrum

Most common implementation of Agile, development team is cross-functional (Scrum Team), with daily standups and operate in sprints. Sprint planning is done ahead of each sprint, with tickets pulled off a wider backlog into the sprint backlog. Post sprint retrospectives are conducted, with any unfinished tickets returned back to the wider backlog.

### Agile vs DevOps

Agile is complementary to DevOps. Agile emphasises the concept of short release cycles, MVP and accommodating changing requirements. Similarly, devops focuses on continuous integration, merging code early and releasing features quickly to end users.

Typically, the further along an organisation is in its Agile adoption, the more that DevOps becomes a requirement for them.
