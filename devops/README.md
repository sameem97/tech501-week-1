# What is devops?

- Culture of devs and ops working closely together, a philosophy.
- Aspects of continuous improvement (automation), make developers’ lives easier e.g. click a button to initiate CI/CD.
- Minimise amount of work in progress tickets, so that business value can be delivered faster and get feedback more quickly (agile methodology).
- Smoother handover between dev and ops, get cross-functional teams and remind them that they have the same aim.
- DevOps is all about the business value, we do not want code sitting on a developer’s machine, we need it to get to prod more quickly.
