## Presentation skills

### General feedback

- Include full names on title slide
  
- Have a contents slide
  
- Introduce yourself before speaking e.g. "Hi my name is Sameem and I will be talking about..."

### Slides

#### Content

- Slides should be supporting your presentation, they shouldn't suffice on their own. If they do, too much writing on the slides.
  
- Too much text will distract your audience from listening to you.

- Way to think about the level of writing on the slide: if the audience didn't quite catch what you said, what are the key takeaways you want them to leave with? Absolute minimum.

- Does the audience NEED to know everything on the slides? Think core message, abstraction. Less is more. Has more impact on the audience. Can do several iterations to "trim the fat".
  
#### Visuals

- Add more visuals, especially diagrams. Draw your own if you can.
  
- Reference diagrams if you have put them on there.

#### Design

- Have a conclusion/thank you slide. Summarise the key takeaways. Ask if audience has any questions.

- Animations are a good way to control what your audience sees. Helps again the presentation to support you.

- Minimise number of slides, keep it lean.

- Use of **bold**/*italics* to draw your audience's eyes.

#### Delivery

- speed, slow down.
- vary the tone.
- confidence, project your voice, speak from the chest.
- "check in" with the audience throughout.
- hand gestures, smile, eye contact.
